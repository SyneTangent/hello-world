        <p>I ams writing in code on a junky keyboard.  The key travel makes me want to kick my teeth in backwards, but hey, it's something to use for now while I learn.</p>
        <p>I'm still getting the hang of things, sticking with basics for now, just looking at higher end stuff and being mightily impressed with what I'll be able to do later on.</p>
        <p>Enough about that stuff though!  Now a little about myself: I am a 33 year old married male homosapien with a kiddo in tow.  If you asked me 3 years ago if I'd be where I am right now, I would have called you nuts!  <strong>Married</strong>!? No!  <strong>A Kid</strong>!?  Hell to the no!  Time and circumstance have a way of making you look a fool but change for the better.</p>

        <p><a href="www.reddit.com"><b>This</b></a> is one of my very, oh so favorite places to dig into.  Whether I need to laugh or see if I still have a shred of humanity left in me, I peruse the venerated halls of Sub-Reddits for the 'Nets best (and worst).</p>
