# hello-world
Just starting out
Hello! I'm a 32 year old married man, with one adorable 10 month old child. Currently, I work part-time at a Starbucks.  While not a well paying job, it has it's upsides, but ultimately, it's not fulfilling and room for growth seems hard to achieve. I aspire to learn code to get into game and software development to launch a life-long career and give my time meaning, constant learning, and fulfillment.
